directories with full access will have different color codings

# files related commands:
## to create a file :  touch <filename>
## to give full access to file : chmod +x <filename>
## to revoke access from file : chmod -x <filename>
## to list all the files : ls -lrt
## here
-l(to list all files and directories)
r( to show results based on restrictions) 
>> ls -lr (full permission files first)
t( to show results based on time ) 
>> ls -lt ( latest files first )

so best is ls -lrt which means list all files then show using restrictions
and then sort by time. Latest will be shown at the bottom.
